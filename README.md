# You2Txt

I built You2Txt for the Vercel + Nvidia 2-hour hackathon. It turns any YouTube video into a transcribed `.txt` file.

[**This project won first place in the hackathon üèÜ**](https://x.com/FernandoTheRojo/status/1859848547316924465)

It's hosted at [you2txt.com](https://you2txt.com). However, YouTube has been rate limiting requests coming from the lambda, so if you want to use it, you'll have more luck running it locally.

If there's interest, maybe I can set up a self-hosted proxy or raspberry pi for the requests (until that inevitably gets rate limited).
